# sudoku
This is a small sudoku solver using a dancing links algorithm written entirely in C99.

I coded this in about a week as a little fun project, mainly aimed on writing clean and readable C code. As the code base is fairly small and uses only C99 standard features, it should compile on all platforms without issues.

Disclaimer: Since it is a pure C program, compatibility with C++ (such as extern "C" declarations) were deliberately omitted.
